  <li> GOLFING </li> 
 <p> I currently play on the golf team at Vanguard University so golfing is a part of my weekly schedule no matter what. <br>
     Waking up early at 6:30 a.m. for practice can get exhausting throughout the year.<br>
     But I love that it keeps me disciplined and allows me to be competitive.</p>
     
  <li> PHOTOGRAPHY </li>   
 <p> I currently do music photography and personal shoots (specifically portraits. <br> 
     I am hoping to make a living off of shooting photos for famous musicians around the world. </p> 

  <li> SKATEBOARDING </li> 
 <p> I started skating only a few years ago, but it is something that I have come to truly appreciate in my life. <br>
     It has shown to teach me many things about life and relationships, not just the activity Itself. </p>

  <li> COFFEE </li> 
 <p> Ever since I moved to SoCal for college, I have become a bit of a coffee enthusiast! <br> 
     Traveling around to all of the different coffee shops in the area has been a  <br>
     great way to bond with my friends and get to know the area.</p>
